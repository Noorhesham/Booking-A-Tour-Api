- **Create Tours:** Admins can create new tour listings, providing details such as tour name, description, duration, price, and other relevant information.
- **Update Tours:** They can modify existing tour details, allowing for adjustments based on changes in availability, pricing, or tour itinerary.
- **Delete Tours:** Admins can remove tours that are no longer available or relevant, ensuring the tour listings remain accurate and up to date.
- **Manage Users:** Administrators have the ability to manage user accounts, including registration, authentication, profile updates, and account deletion.

## User Management
Users interact with the API primarily through user authentication, profile management, and review submission functionalities:

- **User Registration:** New users can register for an account, providing necessary information such as username, email, and password.
- **User Authentication:** Registered users can log in securely to access personalized features and perform actions such as updating their profiles or submitting reviews.
- **Profile Management:** Users have the ability to update their profile information, including personal details and preferences, to ensure accurate account representation.
- **Review Submission:** Users can submit reviews for tours they have experienced, sharing their feedback and insights with other users to help them make informed decisions.

## Reviews
Reviews play a crucial role in enhancing transparency and trust within the platform:

- **Review Retrieval:** Users can access reviews for specific tours, allowing them to evaluate tour quality and make informed booking decisions.
